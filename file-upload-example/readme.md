#Basic file upload example
This should be as basic of an example on file upload as possible. Using minimum amount of packages and with minimal features.

Front was created with angularCLI and then only changed these files in the front end:
- app.component.ts
- app.component.html
- app.module.ts

Backend is only package.json, which brings in express and multer (for file uploading)
and app.js for the code.
